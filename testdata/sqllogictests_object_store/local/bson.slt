# bson's date format is an int64, of milliseconds since unix epoch;
# which most closely maps to arrow's Date64, and since that's the only
# date format, (the bson "timestamp" type is really a mongodb
# implementation detail, generally regarded to be a mistake.) all
# arrow timetstamp and date types are upcast or truncated into this
# type. (Time64 and Time32 just go to integers)
