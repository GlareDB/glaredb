# Getting Started

The next iteration of GlareDB is under heavy development, and we're not yet
shipping pre-built binaries or library bindings.

The CLI and relating bindings can be built from source by following the
instructions on [development overview].

These docs are incomplete, but offer a preview of [what's to come](https://glaredb.com/blog/whole-new-engine).

[development overview]: ./development/overview
