# File system overview

File systems are a core abstraction in GlareDB that determine how the system
locates and reads data files. Whether youâ€™re working with files stored locally,
hosted over HTTP(S), or stored in cloud object storage, file systems provide a
unified interface for accessing them.

This abstraction makes it easy to query files from different sources using the
same SQL functions.

## File system selection

Which file system GlareDB chooses to use is based on the path provided to
file-reading functions.

Paths that can be parsed as a valid URL and have either "http" or "https" as its
scheme will use the **HTTP File System**. Paths that begin with "s3" will use
the **S3 File System**. Paths that begin with "gs" will use the **GCS File
System**.

Otherwise, GlareDB will fall back to using the **Local File System**.

> When using the WebAssembly bindings, GlareDB does not have access to the local
> file system, and will instead fail with an error indicating it cannot find a
> suitable file system to use for the path.
