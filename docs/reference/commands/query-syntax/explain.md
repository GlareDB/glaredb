# EXPLAIN

`EXPLAIN` statements provide information about how a query will be executed,
showing the unoptimized, optimized, and physical plans for the query.

## Description

`EXPLAIN` displays the execution plan that the GlareDB planner generates for the
supplied statement. The execution plan shows how the tables referenced by the
statement will be scanned and how data will be processed.

The optional `VERBOSE` keyword causes the plan to include additional
information in the plan output.

The optional `FORMAT` option can be used to specify the output format of the
plan. The default format is `TEXT`. `JSON` format can be used for
machine-readable output.

## Examples

Simple EXPLAIN:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM cities;
```

EXPLAIN with VERBOSE option:

```sql
EXPLAIN VERBOSE SELECT * FROM cities;
```

EXPLAIN with JSON format:

```sql
EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON) SELECT * FROM cities;
```
