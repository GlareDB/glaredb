# S3 File System

The S3 file system allows GlareDB to read data directly from Amazon S3 buckets.
This makes it easy to query data stored in cloud-based data lakes without
needing to download files manually.

The S3 file system is enabled by default for the CLI, Python bindings, and
WebAssembly bindings.

## Usage

To read from an S3 bucket, use any supported file-reading function with an
`s3://` URI:

```sql
SELECT * FROM read_csv('s3://my-bucket/cities.csv');
```

This reads the `cities.csv` file from the `my-bucket` bucket.

## Optional Parameters

When accessing private S3 buckets, you can provide AWS credentials directly as
options:

```sql
SELECT * FROM read_csv(
  's3://my-private-bucket/secure.csv',
  access_key_id = 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
  secret_access_key = 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
);
```

### Supported Options

| Option              | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `access_key_id`     | AWS Access Key ID                                                           |
| `secret_access_key` | AWS Secret Access Key                                                       |
| `region`            | AWS regions where the bucket is located, defaults to "us-east-1" if omitted |

## Supported Formats

All supported file formats, such as CSV and Parquet, can be read using the S3
file system using their respective functions (e.g. `read_csv`).

## Notes

- Public files can be accessed without authentication.
- Access keys and secrets must be provided when querying non-public buckets.
  Session-level configuration for keys will be added in the future.
