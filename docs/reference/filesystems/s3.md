# S3 File System

The S3 file system allows GlareDB to read data directly from Amazon S3 buckets.
This makes it easy to query data stored in cloud-based data lakes without
needing to download files manually.

The S3 file system is enabled by default for the CLI, Python bindings, and
WebAssembly bindings.

## Usage

To read from an S3 bucket, use any supported file-reading function with an
`s3://` URI:

```sql
SELECT * FROM read_csv('s3://my-bucket/cities.csv');
```

This reads the `cities.csv` file from the `my-bucket` bucket.

## Optional Parameters

When accessing private S3 buckets, you can provide AWS credentials directly as
options:

```sql
SELECT * FROM read_csv(
  's3://my-private-bucket/secure.csv',
  access_key_id = 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
  secret_access_key = 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
);
```

### Supported Options

| Option              | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `access_key_id`     | AWS Access Key ID                                                           |
| `secret_access_key` | AWS Secret Access Key                                                       |
| `region`            | AWS regions where the bucket is located, defaults to "us-east-1" if omitted |

## Supported Formats

All supported file formats, such as CSV and Parquet, can be read using the S3
file system using their respective functions (e.g. `read_csv`).

## CORS Configuration for WebAssembly

When accessing S3 buckets from GlareDB running in a browser using WebAssembly,
you need to configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for your S3 bucket to
allow browser-based requests.

To configure CORS for your S3 bucket:

1. Navigate to your S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console
2. Go to **Permissions** -> **Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)**
3. Add the following JSON configuration:

```json
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "*"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET",
            "HEAD"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "*"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": []
    }
]
```

This configuration allows GET and HEAD requests from any origin, which is
required for GlareDB's WebAssembly bindings to access your S3 bucket.

For more information about CORS configuration for S3, see the [AWS
documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/cors.html).

## Notes

- Public files can be accessed without authentication.
- Access keys and secrets must be provided when querying non-public buckets.
  Session-level configuration for keys will be added in the future.
