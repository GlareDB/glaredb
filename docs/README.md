# Dev docs

Documentation related to the design and implementation of GlareDB.

## Archival

When a doc is out of date, or otherwise is no longer relevant to the product, it
should be archived. Archival is as simple as moving the out-of-date doc to the
`archive` directory (along with with moving any associated diagrams to `archive/diagrams`).
