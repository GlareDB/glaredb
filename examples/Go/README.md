# Go example

ðŸ‘‹ This example demonstrates connecting to an instance of GlareDB and running
an example query in Go. The example requires:

- running `glaredb` locally in `server` mode:

  ```console
  cd ~
  curl https://glaredb.com/install.sh | sh
  ./glaredb server
  ```

- having Go installed and running `main.go`

  ```console
  # from the repository root
  cd examples/Go
  go run main.go
  ```

For more information on installing `glaredb` locally, see: <https://docs.glaredb.com/glaredb/local/>.
