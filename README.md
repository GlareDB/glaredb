# GlareDB (Next)

The next iteration of GlareDB.

The `main` branch contains all work in progress code for the next iteration. The
DataFusion based GlareDB code is in the `legacy` branch.

The code is still a bit aways from being production ready, but you can try out
the early versions either via <https://next.glaredb.com> or as a python library
with `pip install rayexec` ("rayexec" was the early name for the replacement
engine).

# Development history

GlareDB Next (rayexec) was originally developed in a separate repo:
<https://github.com/GlareDB/glaredb_next>

That repo contains all PRs and discussions around development.
